  Use this file as a model for your own organization's branding package. You can
  also place custom versions of questions from ql_baseline.yml into this file.

  Then, reference this package in your own interview YAML file. For example,
  if you added this file to a package named "ALMyState", you might have 
  an include block in each interview that looks like this:
    ---
    include:
      - docassemble.ALMyState:custom_ssl.theme.yml

########################### Bootstrap theme ##############################
comment: |
  If you would like to customize:
  - button style
  - fonts
  - theme colors

  You should generate a bootstrap theme file instead of overriding individual
  CSS properties.

  Instructions available here:
  https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/customization/overview/

  Once you generate the theme file: 
  
  1. name it something like "my_theme.css"
  2. Upload it to the "static" folder
  3. add a block like this:
  ---
  features:
    bootstrap theme: my_theme.css
---
#features:
#  bootstrap theme: ptlatheme_bootstrap.min.css

#  How do you know which court to choose?
  
#  The District Court and Superior Court are all courts that can hear
#  any type of case. Housing, Probate and Family and Juvenile Court are
#    **specialist** courts that hear one kind of case.
#  They have judges with special training as well as special 
#  resources available.
  
#  Different courts can make different kinds of decisions. Not every court
#  can give you every kind of help. For example, you can only
#  ask for visitation in the Probate and Family Court. Only
#  the Housing Court or Superior Court can hear discrimination
#  cases.
  
#  Depending on where you live, different courts may be further or closer to
#  your address. There are many district courts all over the state,
#  but each county has only one or a few Superior Courts or specialty
#  courts.
  
#  Choosing a court means thinking about what kind of help you need, as well
#  as which court you can get transportation to on the day of your hearing.
  
#  Only you know the right choice.

#  If you are responding to a case someone else filed, you may not
